### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
#### I'm Atanas, a software developer under development 
##### (...and obviously a dad joke connoisseur)

<br>

ðŸŒ± At the moment I'm working on my **node.js** + **express.js** skills with **React** on the front end. TypeScript coming soon as well.

âš¡ My goal is to become a full-stack dev with robust back-end expertise, so I'm currently learning more about **Java** and **C#**.
