### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
#### I'm Atanas, a software developer, but currently under development 
##### (...and obviously a dad joke connoisseur)

<br>
ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on developing my node.js + express.js skills with React on the frond-end. 

âš¡ I strive to become a fullstack developer with emphasis on the back-end. That's why C# and .NET are on my list, and hopefully, I'll be able to get to them soon.
