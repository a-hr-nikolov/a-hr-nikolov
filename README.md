### Hi there 👋 
#### I'm Atanas, a software developer under development 
##### (...and obviously a dad joke connoisseur)

<br>

📚 I've graduated from a maths high school with a programming profile (C++ focused), then studied psychology and worked in marketing and science communication. Yet I couldn't get programming out of my mind, so here I am now. :) 

⚡ Recent experience:
- **Python** back-end programming and desktop GUI development (completed **StrypesLab Python** at the top of the class)
- Currently developing a library manager for YouTube, mainly to solve the niche problem some brand and channel managers have with the current YouTube library. If you're interested, ask me about it, I have a prototype version!

☝️ I also have some experience with:
- **node.js** + **express.js** for Back-end Development
- **React** for Front-end Development

🌱 Additionally, I spend time learning more about:
- Object-oriented Programming (OOP) with **Java**
- RDBMS and database normalization, PostgreSQL, SQLite, both with raw SQL and ORMs
- Data Structures and Algorithms for coding challenges with **Python**

🔐 Since you are reading this far, I want to tell you a secret. I actually love programming as a concept, even the theoretical stuff (incl. algorithms, paradigms, databases, etc.). I also love sharing my knowledge. People tell me I'm quite good at that actually (plus I already have such projects in other fields). So... hopefully, I'll be able to use that with programming, too!
