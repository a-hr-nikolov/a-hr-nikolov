### Hi there 👋 
#### I'm Atanas, a software developer under development 
##### (...and obviously a dad joke connoisseur)

<br>

📚 I've graduated from a maths high school with a programming profile (C++ focused), then studied psychology and worked in marketing and science communication. Yet I couldn't get programming out of my mind, so here I am now. :) 

⚡ My goal is to become an expert in back-end development.

🌱 I'm currently focused on these areas:
- Object-oriented Programming (OOP) with **Java** and **Python** (in StrypesLab with Python)
- **PostgreSQL** for Relational Database needs
- **MongoDB** for NoSQL needs
- Data Structures and Algorithms with **Python**

☝️ I also have some experience with:
- **node.js** + **express.js** for Back-end Development
- **React** for Front-end Development

My initial projects were in web development with JavaScript (React + Node), but I quickly realized I don't like front end much, and definitely not the biggest fan of JavaScript.

🔐 Since you are reading this far, I want to tell you a secret. I actually love programming as a concept, even the theoretical stuff (incl. algorithms, paradigms, etc.). I also love sharing my knowledge. People tell me I'm quite good at that actually (plus I already have such projects in other fields). So... hopefully, I'll be able to use that with programming, too!
