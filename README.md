# A bit of an introduction 
Hi there! 👋 
I'm **Atanas**, and this is my practice GitHub. It's where I commit my (mostly private) projects, practice tasks, and solutions to coding challenges.

👨‍💻 Currently working as a **Python Developer** at **Strypes (ICT Group)**

⚡ Privately focused on:
- Back-end development with **Python** frameworks (mainly **Django**)
- **Go** for tooling and web development
- Linux tinkering with **OpenSUSE** and **NixOS**

☝️ I also have some experience with:
- Desktop GUI development in **Python** (Tkinter, PyQt/PySide)
- **node.js** with **express.js** for a couple of back-end prototypes
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (and a bit of **React**) for simple front-end development
- **Java** as a learning tool for design patterns and OOP
- RDBMS and database normalization, PostgreSQL, SQLite, raw SQL and ORMs
