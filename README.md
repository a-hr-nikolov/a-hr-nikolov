# A bit of an introduction 
Hi there! 👋 
I'm **Atanas**, and this is my practice GitHub. What does that mean? Well, here I commit my (mostly private) projects, new languages that I'm learning, and some challenges.

⚡ Recent experience:
- **Python** back-end programming and desktop GUI development (completed **StrypesLab Python** at the top of the class)
- Currently developing a library manager for YouTube, mainly to solve a niche problem some brand and channel managers have with how the YouTube library works at the moment. If you're interested, ask me about it, I have a prototype version!

☝️ I also have some experience with:
- **node.js** + **express.js** for Back-end Development
- **React** for Front-end Development

🌱 Additionally, I spend time learning more about:
- Object-oriented Programming (OOP) with **Java**
- RDBMS and database normalization, PostgreSQL, SQLite, raw SQL and ORMs
- Data structures and algorithms for coding challenges with **Python**

👯 I love programming as a concept, even the theoretical stuff (incl. algorithms, paradigms, etc.). I also enjoy sharing my knowledge. People tell me I'm quite good at that actually. So... hopefully, I'll be able to use that with programming, too!
