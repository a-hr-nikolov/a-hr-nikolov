# A bit of an introduction 
Hi there! 👋 
I'm **Atanas**, and this is my practice GitHub. What does that mean? This is where I commit my (mostly private) projects, practice tasks when learning new languages, and some challenges.

👨‍💻 Currently working as a **Python Developer** at **Strypes (ICT Group)**

⚡ Recent experience:
- **Python** back-end programming and desktop GUI development (completed **StrypesLab Python** at the top of the class)
- Also studying Go for web development in conjunction with Python

☝️ I also have some experience with:
- **Java** as a learning tool for design patterns and OOP
- **node.js** + **express.js** for prototype Back-end Development
- **React** for Front-end Development

🌱 Additionally, I spend time learning more about:
- RDBMS and database normalization, PostgreSQL, SQLite, raw SQL and ORMs
- Data structures and algorithms for coding challenges with **Python**
