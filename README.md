### Hi there 👋 
#### I'm Atanas, a future developer, currently under development 
##### and obviously a dad joke connoisseur

<br>
🌱 I'm currently working on developing my node.js + express.js skills with React on the frond-end.

⚡ My ultimate goal is to become a backend developer, who can also do fullstack stuff. That's why C# and .NET are on my list, hopefully, I'll be able to get to them soon.
