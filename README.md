# A bit of an introduction 
Hi there! 👋 
I'm **Atanas**, and this is my practice GitHub. It's where I commit my (mostly private) projects, practice tasks, and solutions to coding challenges.

👨‍💻 Currently working as a **Python Developer** at **ICT Strypes**

⚡ Focused on:
- Back-end development with **Go** and **Python** frameworks (mainly **Django**)
- Linux tinkering with **OpenSUSE**

☝️ I also have some experience with:
- Desktop GUI development in **Python** (Tkinter, PyQt/PySide)
- **JavaScript** (**React**, **node.js** + **express.js**) for basic full-stack projects
- **Java** as a learning tool for design patterns and OOP
- RDBMS and database normalization, **PostgreSQL**, **SQLite**, raw SQL and ORMs
