### Hi there 👋 
#### I'm Atanas, a software developer under development 
##### (...and obviously a dad joke connoisseur)

<br>

📚 I've graduated from a maths high school with a programming profile (C++ focused), then studied psychology and worked in marketing and science communication. Yet I couldn't get programming out of my mind, so here I am now. :) 

⚡ My goal is to become a full-stack dev with a focus on back-end development.

🌱 I'm currently focused on these areas:
- **node.js** + **express.js** for Back-end Development, will probably transition to **Java**
- **React** for Front-end Development
- **PostgreSQL** for Relational Database needs
- **MongoDB** for NoSQL needs
- Data Structures and Algorithms with **Python**
- Object-oriented Programming (OOP) with **Java**

☝️ Sounds a bit too much? I've found I understand programming better, if I can look at it through different paradigms.
